# nexusPHP_scraper_based_adoption_system
 This is a scraper based nexusPHP adoption system. It collects info from the site and saved to local storage to minimize the traffic. In case of an interruption, you can restart the script and it will pickup from the break point.  It's deprecated since it relies heavily on the webpage, which is unstable, and it also burdens the server.
